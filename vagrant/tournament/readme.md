Tournament project structure:
 - tournament.sql: create the database and tables needed for the project
 - tournament.py: create functions to register players, report scores, get player standings and player pairings for subsequent matches.
 - tournament_test.py: unit tests for the functions in tournament.py. Added a few additional test function calls (uncomment out to run these).
 
 To test the project,
 - install virtual machine or ensure you have access to PostGresql database.
 - execute the .sql file so database schema is ready.
 - execute tournament_test.py to run unit tests.
 - add your own function calls to do any additional testing.
